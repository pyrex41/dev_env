		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up project structure and Docker Compose configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on creating the directory structure, defining the docker-compose.yml with all services and their configurations, and setting up initial files like Makefile and .env.example.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a multi-service Docker environment with specific configurations, volumes, and dependencies, requiring Docker expertise and attention to detail for persistence and networking, making it moderately complex with multiple components to coordinate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure PostgreSQL service with persistence",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this task into subtasks for defining the PostgreSQL service in docker-compose.yml, configuring the named volume and environment variables, and adding the health check.",
			"reasoning": "Configuring a single database service with persistence, environment variables, and health checks is straightforward but requires careful handling of volumes and connectivity, resulting in medium complexity due to potential data persistence issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Redis service",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Focus on a single subtask to define the Redis service in docker-compose.yml, including volume configuration, environment variables, and health check.",
			"reasoning": "This is a focused task on setting up one service with basic persistence and health checks, similar to PostgreSQL but simpler, leading to lower complexity as it builds directly on the base compose file."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Node/TypeScript API service",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for creating the multi-stage Dockerfile, configuring volumes for hot reload, setting up debug port and environment variables, and integrating database migrations on startup.",
			"reasoning": "Involves advanced Docker practices like multi-stage builds, hot reloading, debugging, and dependency on multiple services, increasing complexity due to integration challenges and testing requirements for API functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure React/TypeScript frontend service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for building the Dockerfile, mounting volumes for hot reload, configuring the Vite dev server with environment variables, and ensuring dependency on the API service.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the API service but for a frontend stack, requiring knowledge of Vite and React development in containers, with moderate complexity from hot reload and service dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Makefile commands for local development",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for writing the core Makefile targets (dev, down, logs), adding logic for .env handling, and implementing colored output and progress indicators.",
			"reasoning": "Writing a Makefile with scripting logic, health check waiting, and user-friendly features requires shell scripting skills and coordination with Docker Compose, making it moderately complex due to the need for robust error handling and UX."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Handle configuration with .env files",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a single subtask to define all required variables in .env.example, ensure .env is gitignored, and verify usage in docker-compose.yml.",
			"reasoning": "This is a configuration-focused task with low technical barriers, primarily involving listing variables and ensuring proper file management, resulting in lower complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add health checks and dependency ordering",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for defining health checks for each service in docker-compose.yml and configuring depends_on with service_healthy conditions.",
			"reasoning": "Modifying the compose file for health checks and ordering builds on existing services, requiring understanding of Docker health checks and startup sequences, with medium complexity due to testing the ordering."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement P1 features: seeding, testing, and deployment setup",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for extending the Makefile with seed, reset, and test targets, creating a prerequisites check script, and setting up the Kubernetes Helm chart structure with templates for all services and deployment commands.",
			"reasoning": "This task encompasses multiple areas including data seeding, testing frameworks, and Kubernetes deployment with Helm, introducing significant complexity due to the breadth of technologies (Docker, K8s, Helm) and the need for integration across environments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create documentation and developer experience enhancements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for writing the README.md with quickstart and troubleshooting, and enhancing the Makefile with colored output, progress indicators, and service URL display.",
			"reasoning": "Focused on documentation and UX improvements, this task requires writing clear guides and modifying scripts for better feedback, with medium complexity due to the emphasis on user experience and comprehensive coverage."
